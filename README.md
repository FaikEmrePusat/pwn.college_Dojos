# 🧠 pwn.college — My Learning Notes

Welcome to my personal collection of learning notes from [pwn.college](https://pwn.college/), a fantastic platform for cybersecurity training. This repository serves as a **knowledge base** of what I’ve learned through hands-on challenges — from binary exploitation to system security and beyond.

⚠️ **No solutions or challenge flags are shared here.** Instead, this repo is focused on documenting what I’ve learned: techniques, tools, and takeaways from each topic.
